Tutorial for GitHub. Bear with me if you please.

My name is Viviana. I am a Management Information Systems major looking to learn how to code and start a few projects. I have a few ideas roaming around, but no idea were to start. About me? I love to create things (crafts, digital or physical art), read, go to the movies, and explore my hometown. I have a variety of interests - music, art, martial arts, TV shows, anime, soccer, technology, and so on.
